<h2>About Me</h2>
<p1>

<h4>Introduction</h4>  
  My name is Riley Callahan. I am a senior studying for a bachelor's degree in computer information systems, and I am also studying for a minor in psychology. 

<h4>Future Goals</h4>
My dream job would be a job as a computer programmer. I have always enjoyed creating and perfecting functional applications. The problem-solving and creativity aspects involved in coding have always been intriguing to me.  Computer programming can be a challenging field, but consistent learning and improvement over time to overcome any challenges that are presented in the process toward reaching a goal is an aspect of programming that I excitedly await.

<h4>Workplace Values</h4>
Computer programming requires skills in problem-solving,  mastery of several programming languages, debugging expertise, mathematical competency,  and communication skills. initially, the ideal work environment is an in-house position. I appreciate the job stability and consistency provided by working in-house. However, I also wish to avoid the standard 9-5 working hours. A flexible position, where work can be completed at my own pace is desirable.  Several years of working in-house will provide the skills and experience to switch to a freelancing position down the road. Freelancing allows for a much more flexible schedule and work hours. The additional flexibility will allow for more time spent with family and traveling. I strongly believe an even work-life balance is necessary to live happily. Therefore, I will strive to find a position that fits the criteria.
